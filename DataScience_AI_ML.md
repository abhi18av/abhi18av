## Work related to the Data science / Machine Learning
 
Unfortunately, in this case I can’t share or show you the work at all or even share the PRs since I’m no longer a part of the Github/Gitlab organizations, however you are most welcome to try out the devnagri.com services powered by Vaani (NLP and translation engine).
 
Other than that, please try to understand that the culture of Data Science (as opposed to web engineers) is not quite open source contribution oriented (most DS don’t even need to understand Git at all), unless they are researching on that particular topic and are paid to specifically work on those open source tools (like tensorflow or DeepLearning4J), mostly due to the fact that the data they are working with is often private to the orgs.
 
Regarding that web scraping example I gave earlier, there’s a similar project by some NSIT undergrads which were interning at Devnagri at the time.

The tool used here was the ammonite shell (scala) which allows people to simply use any JVM library at the command line without the burden of Selenium and IDE setups. I relied on the same tool myself to do the scraping from https://itaindia.org/translators/ to decide the location and language of the meetups. Though, these days I’ve moved on to an even simpler setup https://blog.learningdollars.com/2019/11/28/how-i-learned-to-do-browser-automation-with-a-clojure-repl/
 
Beyond their internship at Devnagri, I mentored them

Their final project (ML applied to Natural Language Processing)

During my recent post graduate diploma from IIIT-B, I did end up pushing some code (rough) to Github
