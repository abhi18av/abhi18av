## Work related to the Data science / Machine Learning
  
Regarding that web scraping example, there’s a similar project by some NSIT undergrads which were interning at Devnagri at the time which uses the same techniques I used for scraing the translator data for Kutumbh (translator) meetups for devnagri.com

The tool used here was the ammonite shell (scala) which allows people to simply use any JVM library at the command line without the burden of Selenium and IDE setups. I relied on the same tool myself to do the scraping from https://itaindia.org/translators/ to decide the location and language of the meetups. Though, these days I’ve moved on to an even simpler setup https://blog.learningdollars.com/2019/11/28/how-i-learned-to-do-browser-automation-with-a-clojure-repl/
 
Beyond their internship at Devnagri, I mentored them
 
- Towards a journal publication (Data Science)

- Their final project (ML applied to Natural Language Processing)

During my recent post graduate diploma from IIIT-B, I did end up pushing some code (rough) to Github
