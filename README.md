### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

[Fulcro - ReactJS - ecosystem](https://github.com/abhi18av/abhi18av/blob/master/Fulcro_ReactJS_Ecosystem.md)

 
Work related to the Data science / Machine Learning
 
Unfortunately, in this case I canâ€™t share or show you the work at all or even share the PRs since Iâ€™m no longer a part of the Github/Gitlab organizations, however you are most welcome to try out the devnagri.com services powered by Vaani (NLP and translation engine).
 
Other than that, please try to understand that the culture of Data Science (as opposed to web engineers) is not quite open source contribution oriented (most DS donâ€™t even need to understand Git at all), unless they are researching on that particular topic and are paid to specifically work on those open source tools (like tensorflow or DeepLearning4J), mostly due to the fact that the data they are working with is often private to the orgs.
 
Regarding that web scraping example I gave earlier, thereâ€™s a similar project by some NSIT undergrads which were interning at Devnagri at the time.
 
https://github.com/A-Infinite/WebUIAutomation
 
The tool used here was the ammonite shell (scala) which allows people to simply use any JVM library at the command line without the burden of Selenium and IDE setups. I relied on the same tool myself to do the scraping from https://itaindia.org/translators/ to decide the location and language of the meetups. Though, these days Iâ€™ve moved on to an even simpler setup https://blog.learningdollars.com/2019/11/28/how-i-learned-to-do-browser-automation-with-a-clojure-repl/
 
Beyond their internship at Devnagri, I mentored them
 
Towards a journal publication (Data Science)

Their final project (ML applied to Natural Language Processing)
https://github.com/A-Infinite/Sarcasm-Detection
 
 
During my recent post graduate diploma from IIIT-B, I did end up pushing some code (rough) to Github

https://github.com/abhi18av/fraud_detection
https://github.com/abhi18av/Risk_Stratification_Assignment
 
 
Work related to the collaboration with researchers
 
Again, the people from this background have a different culture.
 
My core contribution to the collaboration is basically data engineering using the cloud since Genomics is extremely resource heavy. I think, I mentioned this to you earlier, I got started in this field because I wanted to help a Biologist friend and initially I rolled out my own ad-hoc solution for this (using the same ammonite shell I used for web scraping) https://github.com/biodragao-org/tese/tree/master/analysis
 
But later on, I realized that this is not scalable and I invested  time in learning a proper tool called Nextflow (https://www.nextflow.io/) which is an alternative to Apache Spark (big data analytics tool) and relies on Linux based CLI tools rather than requiring the user to implement tools using the spark framework itself. Iâ€™ve given professional training based on this tool and itâ€™s usage with AWS as well. Hereâ€™s one such recorded session https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOZXfAhI0Q8
 
Slowly, I became a member of community driven orgs like nf-core and felt uncomfortable in working with 3000+ Lines of Code pipelines (https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/main.nf) which work fine but cause a lot of friction during customization. Therefore I started nextflow-hub which offers granular (60 LOC - https://github.com/nextflow-hub/tb-profiler/blob/master/main.nf ) and composable process based pipelines with sensible defaults such that anyone without a deep technical background could use the tools which are containerized either by bioconda project or by myself  https://github.com/nextflow-hub-containers for true reproducibility.
 
Unfortunately, bioinformaticians/computational biologists often end up abandoning projects after the publication of their papers or simply because they are now working on different problems. However, I am not comfortable as an engineer with the status quo so I try to do some maintenance work (as I need to use these tools) rather then adding features (which requires domain knowledge).

And finally, some work related to the current engagement with the Cricinfo rewrite project.
 
For obvious reasons I canâ€™t share the code at all, however, I can give you a glimpse of the overall contribution across the 5 repositories dedicated to this project. The tech stack is mentioned on my CV (available on LinkedIn).
